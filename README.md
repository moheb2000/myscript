# myscript
A script for creating  an executable shell script file
THis is a simple script and I right it just for learning.

When I'm learning shell script there are three steps to do:
1) add #!/bin/bash at first line of code
2) change chmod to 755 to create a execuyable file
3) wright shell script code

so this script do step 1 & 2 and open vi for coding
